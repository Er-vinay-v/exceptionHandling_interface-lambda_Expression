Assignment Solutions


1.What is an interface in Java?
Ans : Such types of classes haven't any method body. Also, there isn't a main method called interface.In java interfaces provide us extra features and security like encapsulation and data hiding.Interface provide 100% encapsulation compared with abstract classes.


2.Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an interface ? explain with an example.
Ans : In interface there are two modifiers allowed i.e public and default,the abstract modifier by default added by compiler.shown below the example -


 Interface Example
{
public void add(int a,int b); 
public void soundanimal();
}




3.What is the use of interfaces in Java ?or  why do we use interfaces in Java?
Ans : In java interfaces provide us some special facility and features like -
i. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction .
ii.In java multiple inheritance is not allowed for class level but if i use interface then we are able to extend multiple interfaces simultaneously.
iii.Programmers use interfaces to customize features of software differently for different objects.




4.What is the difference between abstract class and  interface ?
Ans : There are some basic difference between this two classes i.e →


S.N
	abstract class
	interface
	1.
	In abstract class at least one abstract method.
	But in the interface all the methods are abstract.
	2.
	In abstract classes are allowed for static and non-static methods.
	In the interface there are no static methods.
	3.
	This class may have a method body.
	But interfaces have only method definition.
	4.
	It provides 0 (zero) to 90 % abstraction.
	But it provides 100% abstraction and encapsulation.
